                    He was the son of King Suddhodhana and Queen Mayadevi of the Sakya clan in Lumbini. One night, his mother dreamed of a white elephant ascending down from heaven to earth and entering into her womb. The white elephant meant that the baby in her womb was
                    pure and powerful. His mother died seven days after his birth and he was raised by is step-mother Gotami. After his birth, during his naming ceremony, a priest had predicted that the prince will be a great spiritual leader one day
                    and abandon all the worldly pleasures. His father was afraid that the prince will leave the palace so the King always kept him inside the palace.</p>
                <p>The King tried to keep Buddha away from the sorrows and pain and provided every facility. He got royal education and training inside the palace and was married at the age of 16 to a beautiful princess Yasodhara. One day, when he went out
                    of the palace in his chariot, he saw an old man, a sick man, a dead man and a monk who was very happy and clam. He went to temples searching for the reason for sufferings but could not find anything. Even though his charioteer tried
                    to explain him that these states are inevitable, he could not but keep thinking about it. Few days after his son Rahul was born, he secretly went out of the palace at night.
