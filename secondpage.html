            <h2>
                Mt.K2
            </h2>
            <p>
                K2 is a vast pyramid-like behemoth that straddles Pakistan-administered Kashmir and China-administered territory of the Kashmir region. Its status as the 2nd highest mountain in the world is thanks to its elevation above sea level, which is 28,251 feet
                or 8,611 metres. Although a 2014 survey put it at 8,609 metres.

                When surveyor Thomas Montgomerie named the second highest peak in the world K2, he probably didn’t imagine it would stick. He was carrying out a survey of the Karakoram Range in 1856 and gave all the mountains there such monikers. There was a K1, K3 and
                so one. The K stood for Karakoram and the numbers… Well, that was the order in which Montgomerie saw the mountains. In time, all the other Ks were renamed. But not so for K2. Fortunately, this miserly moniker is not the only name K2 goes
                by. The Chinese fittingly call it Qogir, meaning Big Mountain.
